> Welcome message with call to action to take user to contact form through use of Submit Button.  
> Service card section showcasing the services offered.
> Footer section with details of phone number, email and instagram link

**Lessons**
> The lesson page should outline the lessons available to the student.  
> The lesson page should allow for the ability to book a lesson directly under the description.
> The lesson page should also have an informational video on RSA approved EDT lessons.  

**Testimonials**
> The portfolio page should show images of successful students and comments they have made about D'Arcy Driving school.

**Gift Vouchers**
> The Gift Voucher page should allow customers the ability to order a gift voucher through the use of a dropdown menu in a form.  

**Contact**
> The contact page should have a contact form for the student to make an enquiry or request quote.  
> The form should collect contact details for the customer so that the owner can contact them.
